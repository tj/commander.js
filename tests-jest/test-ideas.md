# Test Ideas

Noting testing ideas as working through existing tests to check whether covered later.

- options are not positional
  - program option before and after command
  - program option before and after program argument
  - command option before and after command argument
- how much is parsing of program same as parsing of command, how much needs testing both program and command?
- options.values: -p80, -p 80, --port 80, --port=80
