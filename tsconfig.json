  /*
    TypeScript is being used to do type checking across both JavaScript and TypeScript file.
    In particular, this picks up some problems in the JSDoc in the JavaScript files, and validates the code
    is consistent with the JSDoc.
     
    A complication is that TypeScript and VSCode do not directly support different config for .ts/.js,
    To avoid drowning in strict errors that are tedious to avoid in JavaScript the settings here turn off some checks.
     
    The settings here are used by VSCode, so TypeScript checks are enabled in included JavaScript files.
    
    See also tsconfig.js.json and tsconfig.ts.json.
